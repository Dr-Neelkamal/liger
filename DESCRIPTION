Description: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a computational method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states. The original algorithm is detailed in Subramanian, Tamayo, et al. with Java implementations available through the Broad Institute. The liger package provides a lightweight R implementation of this enrichment test on a list of values. Given a list of values, such as p-values or log-fold changes derived from differential expression analysis or other analyses comparing biological states, this package enables you to test a priori defined set of genes for enrichment to enable interpretability of highly significant or high fold-change genes.
